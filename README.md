# Temporal--Processing

Created a final image that made a new white image with the same demensions as the pictures.
I used a nested loop to get the data of the pixels for each image at the exact same coordinates,
added all of it to the empty list, sorted the empty list. 
After getting the median of all that pixel data, I put on the plain white background image and save
it as a png file outside my loops.
